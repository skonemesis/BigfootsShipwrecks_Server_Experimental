/*
 * Bigfoot's Shipwrecks - Maintain Shipwreck Events
 * Updated by: sko & Ghost PGM DEV TEAM
 * 
 * This script continuously checks for player proximity to shipwreck crates.
 * If a player enters the defined range, the wreck's marker is removed and a
 * notification is sent to all players.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Monitors active shipwreck locations.
 * - Removes markers when players approach the crate.
 * - Sends global notifications when a crate is found.
 * - Standardized variable naming to match BS_count_shipwrecks from config.sqf
 * - Ensured marker existence check before retrieving position
 * - Added structured comments for clarity
 * - 
 *
 * Configurable Variables (Defined in config.sqf):
 * - BS_count_shipwrecks: Number of shipwrecks to track
 * - BS_player_showCrateClaimMessageRadius: Distance at which a crate is detected
 * - BS_player_showCrateClaimMessage: Enables/disables global notifications
 * - Improved logging to help track crate recoveries
