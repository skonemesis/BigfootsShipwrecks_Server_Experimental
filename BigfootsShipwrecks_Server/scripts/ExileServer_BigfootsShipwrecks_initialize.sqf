/*
 * Bigfoot's Shipwrecks - Initialization Script
 * Updated by: sko & Ghost PGM DEV TEAM
 * 
 * This script initializes the shipwreck spawning system, ensuring that 
 * wrecks and loot crates appear at random ocean locations on server start.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Spawns configurable shipwrecks with loot crates.
 * - Places markers on wreck locations.
 * - Monitors shipwreck areas for player interactions.
 * - Notifies all players when a crate has been claimed.
 *
 * Configurable Variables (Defined in config.sqf):
 * - BS_count_shipwrecks: Number of shipwreck events.
 * - BS_locations_center: Center position for shipwreck spawning.
 * - BS_locations_distance_min: Minimum distance from center.
 * - BS_locations_distance_max: Maximum distance from center.
 * - BS_class_wreckage: Types of shipwreck objects to spawn.
 * - BS_class_crate: Types of loot crates to spawn.
 * - BS_loot_itemCargo: Loot items available in crates.
 * - BS_loot_count_poptabs_seed: Randomized poptab distribution.
 * - BS_debug_logCrateFill: Enables logging of loot contents.
