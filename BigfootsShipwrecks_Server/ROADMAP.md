Prioritization of Features Based on Feasibility & Impact

We'll group features into three categories:
âœ… High Feasibility & High Impact (Quick wins, minimal performance impact)
ðŸŸ¡ Medium Feasibility & Medium Impact (Requires balancing, some scripting complexity)
ðŸ”´ Low Feasibility & High Complexity (Heavy scripting, possible performance concerns)
âœ… Phase 1: High Feasibility & High Impact (Quick Wins)
1. AI Behavior & Mission Scaling

    âœ… Tiered Mission Difficulty â€“ Spawn stronger AI & better loot based on a wreckâ€™s difficulty level.
    âœ… Stealth Mechanics for Underwater AI â€“ Reduce AI detection range for swimming/diving players.
    âœ… AI Divers Loot Dead Players â€“ AI can steal a portion of player loot and store it in crates.
    âœ… Player-Triggered Wreck Events â€“ Players activate sonar scans to detect hidden wrecks.

2. Crate & Loot Upgrades

    âœ… Booby-Trapped Crates â€“ Some crates explode or release gas if not disarmed.
    âœ… Legendary Wrecks (Rare Spawns) â€“ Ultra-rare shipwrecks appear with high-tier loot.

3. AI Interactions

    âœ… Reinforcement AI Tied to Player Proximity â€“ Instead of fixed timers, backup AI only spawns if players stay near the land crate.
    âœ… Patrolling AI Boats & Submarines â€“ AI patrols around wrecks in boats, mini-subs, or SDVs.
    âœ… Land AI Protects Mission Gear & Calls Backup â€“ If AI on land are killed, reinforcements arrive by air, land, or sea.

4. Player Features

    âœ… Persistent Wrecks â€“ Wreck remains visible on the map until looted.
    âœ… Crate Carry & Swim Functionality â€“ Players can carry, swim with, and load crates into vehicles.

ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Medium Feasibility & Medium Impact (Requires Balancing)
1. AI Enhancements

    ðŸŸ¡ Faction-Based AI â€“ Friendly & enemy AI fight each other at randomly generated wreck sites.
    ðŸŸ¡ AI Traders at Shipwrecks â€“ Neutral AI divers sell rare gear near wrecks.
    ðŸŸ¡ Backup AI Can Loot Mission Crates â€“ AI reinforcements steal mission items and extract.

2. Mission Variations

    ðŸŸ¡ Escort & Extraction Missions â€“ Example: Rescue an AI diver carrying valuable intel.
    ðŸŸ¡ Underwater Puzzle Mechanics â€“ Wrecks contain locked crates requiring players to find hidden keys.

3. Crate & Loot Upgrades

    ðŸŸ¡ Player-Owned Salvage Companies â€“ Allow clans to claim & defend wreck sites.
    ðŸŸ¡ Loot Scaling Based on Wreck Location â€“ Deeper wrecks = better loot, but harder AI.

ðŸ”´ Phase 3: Low Feasibility & High Complexity (Heavy Scripting, Performance Risks)
1. AI Reinforcement Complexity

    ðŸ”´ Dynamic AI Response Based on Players Online â€“ AI spawns in different strengths depending on active player count.
    ðŸ”´ AI May Have Their Own Mission Objectives â€“ AI tries to retrieve valuable items before players do.

2. Advanced AI Support

    ðŸ”´ Zeus Integration â€“ Allows admins to manually spawn AI at wreck sites.
    ðŸ”´ AI Air Drops for Backup â€“ AI paratroopers deploy from helicopters.

3. World Events & Persistent Features

    ðŸ”´ Towing Large Shipwrecks to Shore â€“ Salvage missions where players tow entire shipwrecks to a processing yard.
    ðŸ”´ Underwater Bases or Hideouts â€“ Some wrecks hide secret underwater bunkers with supplies.

Next Steps: Phase 1 Implementation
âœ… Start with the fastest wins that will create the biggest impact:

    AI Scaling & Smart Reinforcements (Land + Water AI reacting dynamically)
    Stealth Mechanics for Underwater AI (Adjust AI perception for divers)
    Crate Pickup & Swimming System (Players can transport crates across water)
    Patrolling AI Boats & Mini-Subs (AI using SDVs and small boats for recon)
    Legendary Wrecks & Loot Scaling (Rare wrecks with ultra-valuable loot)
    Booby-Trapped Crates (Players must check for traps before looting)
